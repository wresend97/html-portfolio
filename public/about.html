<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi, I'm William Resendiz—a problem solver at heart with a background in HVAC, a passion for technology, and a 
  newfound love for web development. While I currently work in the fast-paced world of coffee, crafting the perfect 
  cup and delivering great customer experiences, I'm actively transitioning into the tech industry.</p>

<p>My journey started with hands-on problem-solving in HVAC, where I learned how systems work, how to troubleshoot 
    effectively, and how to think critically under pressure. Now, I'm applying those same skills to coding—breaking 
    down complex challenges, writing clean and efficient code, and continuously learning new technologies.</p>


<p>I'm currently building projects in Visual Studio Code and sharpening my skills every day. My goal is to bring a 
    unique blend of technical expertise, adaptability, and customer-focused thinking to a role in web development.</p>

<p>Let’s connect—I'd love to collaborate, learn, and grow in the industry!</p>
